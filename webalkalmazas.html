                    <p class="text">International Space Station (ISS): A $150-billion contraption floating 270 miles above Earth is one of the most impressive achievements of humankind.
                        It's called the International Space Station (ISS), and a rotating astronaut crew has occupied it since 2000. 
                        The work of those astronauts has yielded some incredible scientific insights.</p>

                        unique perspective — for example, in one 24-hour period, they see not one sunrise and sunset, but 16 on average.
                        Each changeover between day and night is marked by the terminator, a line on Earth's surface separating the sunlit side 
                        from the darkness.</p>

                        the view of our planet has become even more spectacular for those on board. The small module is designed for the observation of 
                        operations outside the station such as robotic activities, the approach of vehicles, and spacewalks. But the direct, nadir 
                        view of Earth through the windows is what astronauts enjoy the most.</p>

                        Its crew spent three days on the lunar surface, collecting samples and conducting experiments.
                        While China has said it aims to land astronauts on the Moon by the 2030s, in the decades since 
                        the Apollo 17 mission no human has returned to walk on the Moon.</p>

                    <p class="text">Any time an astronaut gets out of a vehicle while in space, it is called a spacewalk. 
                        A spacewalk is also called an EVA. EVA stands for extravehicular activity.
                        The first person to go on a spacewalk was Alexei Leonov. He was from Russia. The first spacewalk was on March 18, 1965. 
                        It was 10 minutes long.</p>

                        International Space Station. But just a few minutes after liftoff, an issue with the Soyuz's rocket triggered 
                        an emergency landing, which both crewmembers survived in good condition.</p>

                        largely due to Elon Musk’s Space X, Mars One and NASA’s activities in this regard. The NASA human landing site selection 
                        committee proposed 47 potential sites for a human occupied base on Mars. They considered not only scientific
